# Fluid Simulator (Rewrite WIP)

A Position Based Fluids/Particles simulator focused on
CPU/CUDA parity, high-performance CUDA kernels, and a simple visualization path.

## Goals
- CPU and CUDA parity for the PBF/PBD solver.
- High-performance CUDA implementation for large particle counts.
- Simple visualization (headless outputs or on-the-fly viewer).

## Status
- Rewrite in progress; build/run docs will be added once the new scaffold lands.
- See `CODEX.md` for rewrite guidance and parity expectations.

## Legacy
- The previous implementation (CS 284A Spring 2020 final project) moved to the [`legacy`](https://github.com/CTKnight/FluidSimulator/tree/legacy) branch, see also: legacy [README](https://github.com/CTKnight/FluidSimulator/blob/legacy/README.md).
