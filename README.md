## Problem Description

## Goals and Deliverables
 
### Deliverables

1. A scalable particle based fluid simulator that outputs vtk format files.

2. A set of fluid videos generated by 3rd party renderers with the simulation results.

3. A GPU accelerated version simulator. (For aspirationsal plan) 

### Performance metrics:

1. Scalability

This includes weak scaling(performance as particles per processors goes up) and strong scaling(performance as the total number of particles goes up). 

2. Visual effect

Although this is a Computer Graphics project rather than a Physics project, where we are not aiming to simulate all physical properties of fluid, at least we should consider some physical constraints that greatly influence the visual effects to make the rendered results look like real.

3. Latency (for aspirational plan)
If the CUDA acceleration works really well, we can make a realtime/interactive fluid simulator and use simplified rendering technique to preview the results on the fly.
