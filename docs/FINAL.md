## Abstract

In the course, we learned how to make a simulation of cloth using the mass and spring-based system with some physical constraints and numerical integration. In this final project, we extend our knowledge to make the simulation of another popular topic-fluid. We want to know how the liquid particles work with each other with some physical constraints to create the liquid effect. We used the Position Based Fluids algorithm to simulate the liquid. In addition, we implemented the novel CUDA accelerator to simulate millions of particles in seconds and real-time 60 fps simulation for thousands of particles. At last, we applied the marching cube algorithm to reconstruct the surface meshes of the liquid and rendered the images and videos with Paraview to create realistic liquid effects for particles.
